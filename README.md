Project Title: Module 1 Challenge Assignment

Description: For this project, I worked on refining an existing webpage by implementing various adjustments to meet specific goals. The main focus was on improving the website's performance and enhancing user experience. To boost Search Engine Optimization (SEO), I added a descriptive title element. Additionally, I optimized the code structure by removing redundancies and organizing it logically. These enhancements not only improve the functionality of the website but also enhance the overall readability and maintainability of the codebase.
